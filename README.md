# Repository

This repository provides two Chrome extensions located in the `extension` and `chatgpt_bookmarker` folders.

- `extension`: Adds a prompt search bar to ChatGPT so you can store prompts with titles and descriptions.
- `chatgpt_bookmarker`: Lets you bookmark ChatGPT conversations for later reference. Saved conversations record whether each message came from the user or the assistant.

## Installation

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and choose the folder for the extension you want to install:
   - Select the `extension` folder for the prompt saver.
   - Select the `chatgpt_bookmarker` folder for the bookmarker extension.

After loading an extension, open ChatGPT to use its new features.
